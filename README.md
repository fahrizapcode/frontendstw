# 🚶‍♂️ Student Walker – Frontend

**Student Walker** is a short-distance delivery request (jastip) application designed especially for students. It enables users to request small errands or deliveries without requiring the service provider (walker) to have a vehicle. Walkers fulfill requests by walking — an efficient solution for campuses and local communities.

This is the **frontend** of the Student Walker project, built using **React Native** and **Expo**.
